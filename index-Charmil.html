            <h2>The Trouble with Bears</h2>
            <p>By Evan Wild</p>
            <p>
                Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, 
                independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like 
                the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, <i>The Jungle Book</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such 
                a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real 
                insight into the life of the bear.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Bear</h3>
            <p>
                Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have 
                seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are 
                just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage 
                different behaviour, as you'll find out below. The table below also gives you some useful 
                facts about bears.
            </p>
